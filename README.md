# Camera Mirror

Allows to mirror a clean camera feed to a browser tab.

Use case:
- You want to share a camera signal in a video conference via screen sharing instead of as the webcam. Most video conference tools support sharing a window, or even specific browser tab.
- This can be useful when you use a capture card to capture some HDMI signal.
